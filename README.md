# SpaceDepth

## Overview
This application utilizes marker-based augmented reality (AR) technology powered by Vuforia and incorporates depth mask concepts to provide a compelling space exploration experience. Users can interact with markers to visualize space elements such as stars, nebulas, the sun, rockets, and more in a real-world environment through their mobile device or AR-compatible hardware.

## Features
- **Marker-Based AR:** Utilizes Vuforia's marker detection to anchor virtual space elements to physical markers.
- **Depth Masking:** Enhances realism by applying depth masking techniques to integrate virtual objects more naturally with the real-world environment.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can interact with AR elements, such as rotating planets, launching rockets, or exploring detailed models of celestial bodies.

## Requirements
- **Unity 2019.4.x:** This project is developed using Unity 3D version 2019.
- **Vuforia SDK:** Integration with Vuforia SDK for marker-based AR functionalities.
- **AR-Compatible Device:** Use a device that supports ARCore (for Android) or ARKit (for iOS) for optimal AR experience.
- **Markers:** Physical markers (printed or displayed) are needed to trigger the AR content.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the project repository from [https://github.com/saumyasinha31/SpaceDepth].
   
2. **Unity Setup:**
   - Open Unity 2019.4.x or later.
   - Navigate to the cloned project directory and open the Unity project.

3. **Vuforia Configuration:**
   - Import the Vuforia SDK into the Unity project if not already included.
   - Set up your Vuforia developer account and add your Vuforia license key to the Vuforia Configuration in Unity.

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Configure your build settings for the target platform (iOS/Android).
   - Build the project and deploy it to your AR-compatible device.

5. **Marker Placement:**
   - Print or display Vuforia-compatible markers.
   - Use these markers to trigger the AR space elements in the application.

## Usage
- Launch the application on your AR-compatible device.
- Point the device's camera towards a Vuforia marker.
- The marker will trigger the display of space elements such as nebulae, stars, planets, rockets, etc.
- Interact with the AR elements as per the application's interactive features.

## Troubleshooting
- If markers do not trigger AR elements:
  - Ensure proper lighting conditions.
  - Check Vuforia license key validity.
  - Verify marker quality and alignment.
